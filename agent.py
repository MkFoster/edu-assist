College Search Agent - Strands AI Agent Implementation
====================================================

This module creates and configures a Strands AI agent powered by Amazon Bedrock 
(Claude 4.5 Sonnet) for helping users find colleges and academic programs using 
the U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard API.

Key Features:
- AWS Bedrock integration with Claude 4.5 Sonnet model
- Custom tools for college/program search and details
- Environment variable management for AWS credentials
- Production-ready configuration for AWS App Runner deployment

Architecture:
- Strands Agent framework for AI orchestration
- Custom tools registered via decorators
- Secure credential handling via environment variables
- Support for both local development and cloud deployment

Usage:
    # For local development
    python agent.py
    
    # For web deployment (called by web_app.py)
    from agent import make_agent
    agent = make_agent()

Environment Variables Required:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: AWS access key for Bedrock access
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: AWS secret key for Bedrock access  
- AWS_REGION: AWS region (default: us-east-1)
- COLLEGE_SCORECARD_API_KEY: Department of Education API key
- STRANDS_MODEL_ID: Bedrock model ID (default: anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0)
